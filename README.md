Python app for the Tesla Inventory API

The used inventory browser at https://www.tesla.com/inventory/used/ does not show all information about the cars.
I'm working on a python app for tracking price changes in used inventory and showing additional information such as the reason for being in inventory, etc.

Currently, this program is just 16 lines of code that spits out a summary .CSV file of the cars available. You have to manually change the URL for ms, mx, etc. or for a different location.
You can track price changes by running the program once daily.
